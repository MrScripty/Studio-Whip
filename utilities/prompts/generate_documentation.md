You are an AI assistant helping me develop `rusty_whip`, a Rust-based 2D & 3D content generation application with Vulkan-based rendering and GUI features. We’ve been coding together in this chat, and you’re aware of all changes made to the codebase so far. Now, I need you to generate updated `architecture.md` and `modules.md` files to reflect the current state of the project. I’ll provide the last versions of these files as a starting point, and you’ll update them based on the coding we’ve done, ensuring they remain concise, high-level overviews for guiding future LLM coding without including full implementation details. Do not summerize existing documentation.

### Instructions

#### General Guidelines
- **Purpose**: These files provide a clear, compact summary of `rusty_whip`’s structure and module roles, keeping context small for efficient LLM use.
- **Tone**: Technical, clear, and neutral—avoid speculative or verbose language.
- **Date**: Set to the current date (today is March 19, 2025).
- **Context**: Use the full chat history to identify changes (e.g., new features, modules, or modifications) since the provided file versions.

#### For `architecture.md`
- **Goal**: Offer a high-level overview of the system design, components, data flows, and interactions.
- **Structure**:
  - **Purpose**: Summarize the project’s goals (e.g., 2D/3D content generation, Vulkan GUI, P2P networking).
  - **Core Components**: List major subsystems (e.g., Vulkan Context, Rendering Engine) with roles and key modules.
  - **Data Flow**: Describe the main sequence (e.g., initialization, interaction, rendering).
  - **Key Interactions**: Highlight dependencies between components (e.g., `Scene` ↔ `Renderer`).
  - **Current Capabilities**: Note implemented features (e.g., click-and-drag, any new additions like undo).
  - **Future Extensions**: List planned features (e.g., P2P, 3D rendering), adjusting based on progress.
  - **Dependencies**: Summarize external libraries and shaders.
  - **Notes**: Add clarifications (e.g., Vulkan coordinate quirks).
- **Update Rules**:
  - Incorporate new components, interactions, or capabilities from chat changes (e.g., undo feature affecting `Scene` and `InteractionController`).
  - Keep it abstract—no function code or low-level details.

#### For `modules.md`
- **Goal**: Document the directory structure, modules, and key structs/functions for a functional overview.
- **Structure**:
  - **Project Overview**: Summarize purpose and current state (e.g., 2D GUI focus, implemented/skipped features).
  - **Module Structure**: Show the directory tree (e.g., `src/gui_framework/`), updating for new files.
  - **Modules and Their Functions**: For each file:
    - **Purpose**: One-sentence role (e.g., “Handles mouse input for dragging”).
    - **Key Structs**: List structs with fields (e.g., `RenderObject: vertices, offset`).
    - **Key Methods**: List signatures (e.g., `translate_object(&mut self, index: usize, dx: f32, dy: f32) -> ()`) with brief purpose.
    - **Notes**: Add dependencies or status (e.g., “Depends on `scene.rs`”, “Undo added”).
  - **Shaders**: List shader files and roles, updating if new ones are added.
  - **Dependencies**: List external crates (e.g., `ash = "0.38"`), adjusting for new dependencies.
- **Update Rules**:
  - Add or modify entries for new/changed files, structs, or methods from the chat (e.g., `previous_offset` in `RenderObject`).
  - Use consistent signatures (inputs -> outputs, e.g., `new() -> Scene`).
  - Cross-reference modules (e.g., “Used by `render_engine.rs`”).
  - Exclude implementation details—focus on purpose and interfaces.

#### Input
- Current `architecture.md`: [Insert the `architecture.md` I provided earlier]
- Current `modules.md`: [Insert your latest `modules.md` from March 17, 2025]

#### Output
- Provide updated `architecture.md` and `modules.md` as separate markdown blocks, reflecting all changes from our coding chat.
- If no changes occurred in the chat, refine the provided files for clarity (e.g., standardize signatures, add cross-references).

#### Example Context
If we added an undo feature in this chat (e.g., `previous_offset` to `RenderObject`, `revert_offset` method, Ctrl+Z in `controller.rs`), update:
- `architecture.md`: Add undo to “Current Capabilities” and note `Scene` ↔ `InteractionController` interaction.
- `modules.md`: Update `scene.rs` with `previous_offset` and `revert_offset`, adjust `controller.rs` for Ctrl+Z handling.

Now, generate the updated `architecture.md` and `modules.md` based on our chat history and the input files I’ll provide next.
