# Task Instrunctions

## Sanity Check
- Analyze the steps in tasks.md ensuring that each step is broken into small incremental parts that are testable
- Cross reference the code with the steps to ensure each step is valid and makes sense
- Be certain that the steps address everything that needs to be modified in the code
- You must have modules.md and architecture.md before starting
- If you have questions about the tasks, ask the user for answers before proceeding
- warn the user if any of the starting code files are excessivly long or likely to become too long by performing the tasks.
- Question the tasks for better alternatives. Do not suggest an alternative uless there is an obviously better solution that meets all the objectives of the tasks.

If any of the above could not be completed or there were issues with the tasks.md or code preventing the steps from being completed, inform the user of the problems and wait for response. Do not begin coding.

## How to Complete Each Task
- You will address only one task at a time
- You will not proceed to the next task until the current task is approved by the user
- Every task must compile without error or warning and must be run to ensure success.
- Do not write out entire files over 100 lines. Instead, provide the existing line of code immediatly above and below the edit and provide the edit in betwene.
