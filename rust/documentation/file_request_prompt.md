I need you to determine which existing files from the codebase, are required to complete the next or current task to work on outlined in `tasks.md`. Format your response as: 

These are the files for <continuing/starting> task <task #, Step #>
<Single line description of the task / Step>
``<space seperated file path list>`` 

Use a space-separated list of full file paths. Only include files that currently exist in the codebase. Do not include files that would need to be created.
