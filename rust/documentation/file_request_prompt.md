I need you to determine which existing files from the codebase, are required to complete the tasks outlined in `tasks.md`. Format your response as a space-separated bash list of full file paths (e.g., `/home/deck/Desktop/Rust/Studio-Whip/rust/src/gui_framework/scene/scene.rs /home/deck/Desktop/Rust/Studio-Whip/rust/src/gui_framework/rendering/render_engine.rs`). Only include files that currently exist in the codebaseâ€”do not include files that would need to be created. Provide the list inside a code block without additional explanation or formatting beyond the space-separated paths.
