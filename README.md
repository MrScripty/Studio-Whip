## Requirements (All Platforms)
- **Vulkan**: 1.3 or later
- **Rust**: Latest stable version (via Rustup)
- **Recommended Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU with 16GB+ VRAM for optimal AI inference

## Setup on Windows
### Dependencies
- **Vulkan 1.3+**: [Download from LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)
- **Rustup**: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Environment Variables
After installing dependencies, add the Vulkan SDK's `glslc` compiler to your `Path`:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `SystemPropertiesAdvanced`, and click `Environment Variables`.
2. Under "System Variables" or "User Variables," select `Path` and click `Edit`.
3. Click `New` and add: `C:\VulkanSDK\<version>\Bin` (replace `<version>` with your installed version).
4. Click `OK` to save.
5. Verify with `glslc --version` in PowerShell.

### Running PowerShell Scripts
Optional development scripts (`.ps1`) may require enabling script execution:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (`Win + R` > `powershell` > `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`).
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
3. Confirm with `Y` if prompted.
4. Scripts should now work. If you see an error like `<scriptName>.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled`, this step resolves it.
